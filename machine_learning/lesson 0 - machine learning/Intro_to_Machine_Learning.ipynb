This enables you with the necessary machine learning tools to solve problems quickly, at the expense of requiring you to trust us with some curation decisions. By the end of the series, you should have a high level understanding of deep neural networks and be able to build/train/evaluate your own models.  "

        "Until recently, nearly every computer application that we interacted with was programmed to process data and perform actions using a set of hard-coded *rules* (we call these rules the *brains*). This process required engineers to spend countless hours considering every possible way users might want to interact with the apps. Consequently, most apps weren't very smart (their brains were limited). For instance, imagine trying to map out every possible action for the following tasks:\n",
        "- Write a program that predicts tomorrow’s weather given geographic information, satellite images, and a trailing window of past weather.\n",
        "- Write a program that takes in a question via a text message, and answers it correctly.\n",
        "- Write a program that given an image can identify all the people it contains, drawing outlines around each.\n",
        "- Write a program that presents users with products that they are likely to enjoy but unlikely, in the natural course of browsing, to encounter.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Impossible! Not even the best programmers can solve these tasks using traditional rule-based coding. The reasons for this may vary. Sometimes the relationship between the data can change. On the other hand, the relationship (say between image pixels, and abstract categories) may be too complex, requiring thousands or millions of computations that are beyond our conscious understanding to hard-code. *Machine learning* (ML) is the study of powerful techniques that can *learn* to solve such complex tasks using *data*. Different from hard-coded programs, ML algorithms are capable of adapting and improving their performance, especially when given lots of data and computing resources. \n",

Each sample typically consists of a collection of numerical attributes. In *supervised learning* problems, a special attribute is designated as the prediction *label*, (sometimes called the *target* or dependent variable).

While these simple models are perfectly capable of addressing simple problems, we want to solve difficult tasks that involve complex data. *Deep neural networks* is a set of powerful techniques to model data. These models consist of many successive transformations of the data called *layers*, which are *connected* together from top to bottom by *weights* and *neurons*, hence the name deep neural networks learning."

        "Earlier, we introduced machine learning as “learning from data”. By learning, we mean improving at some task over time. To this end, we need to develop our model with a formal measure of how good (or bad) it is. In machine learning, and optimization more generally, we call these measures *objective functions*. By convention, we usually define objective functions so that lower is better. This is merely a convention. You can take any function $f$, for which higher is better, and turn it into a new function  $f′$  that is qualitatively identical but for which lower is better by setting  $f′=−f$. Because lower is better, these functions are sometimes called *loss functions* or *cost functions*."

In short, at each step, they check to see, for each parameter, which way the training set loss would move if you changed that parameters just a small amount. They then update the parameter (i.e., weights) in the direction that reduces the loss."
