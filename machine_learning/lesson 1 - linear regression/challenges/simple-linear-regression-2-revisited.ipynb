        "In this challenge, the goal is to find your own dataset on the web (can be the same dataset you found before) and use it to reimplement a linear model to predict the dataset's label variable (which you choose). The difference in this challenge is you will use Tensorflow to build your model rather than Sklearn. In other words, you will build and train a single-layer linear (fully-connected) neural network.  \n",
