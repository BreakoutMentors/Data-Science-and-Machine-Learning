## Section 1: Intro to Reinforcement Learning
**Learning Objective:** In these lessons, you will embark on your journey of Reinforcement Learning! You will learn basic RL terminologies and how these terminologies relate to a Markov Decision Process.

- [Lesson 1: Intro to RL](Lesson-1-Intro-to-RL.ipynb)
- [Lesson 2: Markov Decision Process](Lesson-2-Markov-Decision-Process.ipynb)
- _Challenges:_
    - [Lesson 1 Challenge](Lesson-1-challenge.ipynb)
    - [Lesson 2 Challenge](Lesson-2-challenge.ipynb)

## Section 2: Value-Based Methods
**Learning Objective:** In this lesson, we will talk about
    - Monte Carlo Method (learn by sampling)
    - Temporal Difference Method (a different way of value-update than Monte Carlo)
    - Q-Learning (using a table to store useful value)
    - Deep Q-Learning (Q-Learning using a neural network)

- _Challenge:_
    - [Lesson 3 Challenge](Lesson-3-challenge.ipynb)

## Section 3: Policy-Based Methods
**Learning Objective:** In this lesson, we will compare value-based and policy-based methods. Also, we will discuss the high-level process of policy gradient and introduce one of the policy gradient algorithms: REINFORCE.

- _Challenge:_
    - [Lesson 4 Challenge](Lesson-4-challenge.ipynb)

## Section 4: Additional Topics
**Learning Objective:** In these lessons, we will discuss some additional topics. First, we will talk about two advanced reinforcement learning algorithms: A2C and PPO, and how to use them in practice. Next. we will discuss how to train more than one agent to play a game.

- [Lesson 5: Advantage Actor Critic](Lesson-5-A2C.ipynb)
- [Lesson 6: Proximal Policy Optimization](Lesson-6-PPO.ipynb)
- [Lesson 7: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](Lesson-7-MARL.ipynb)

- _Challenges:_
    - [Lesson 5 Challenge](Lesson-5-A2C-challenge.ipynb)
    - [Lesson 6 Challenge](Lesson-6-PPO-challenge.ipynb)
    - [Lesson 7 Challenge](Lesson-7-MARL-challenge.ipynb)
