        "# Classification: Logistic Regression\n",
        "In [lesson 1 - linear regression](https://github.com/krmiddlebrook/intro_to_graphing_in_python/tree/master/notebooks/machine_learning/lesson%201%20-%20linear%20regression), we learned about linear regression and how it can be used to construct a model to predict a numeric value (i.e., how powerful a Pokemon is given their x values/attributes). In this lesson, we will learn how to solve classification problems using logistic regression. Different from linear regression, logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Some examples of classification problems are email spam or not spam, legendary Pokemon or not, tumor malignant (harmful) or benign (not harmful). We can use logistic regression to transform input data into a probability value to predict the class the data belongs to.\n",

        "Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm in machine learning. In short, logistic regression uses the *sigmoid activation function* (see figure below) to map the input data to a probability value between 0 and 1. In general, the probability threshold is 0.5. For example, if we were predicting whether a pokemon was legendary or not, and the output of the sigmoid function was 0.7 based on the input values of a specific Pokemon, then we would classify that Pokemon as legendary. However, the probability threshold may be lower or higher than 0.5 depending on the task. Below is the graph of a sigmoid function with the equation of the function on top. \n",

        "\n",
        "When we were doing linear regression, the formula was $y=ax+b$. The formula for logistic regression is very similar: $$\n",
        "y = \\sigma(ax+b)\n",
        "$$ where $\\sigma$ represents the sigmoid activation function. The only difference between the formula for logistic regression is that the sigmoid activation function is wrapped around the $ax+b$ terms. Don't worry to much if this doesn't make too much sense yet, it might help to see logistic regression in action."

        "Wow! Our logistic regression model fit the Google Play Store data pretty well, correctly predicting whether an app was free or not about 93.12% of the time. However, the distribution of free apps to non-free apps is not balanced, so we should check the confusion matrix to make sure the model wasn't just predicting every app as \"free\" since there are more of them than \"paid\" apps. A confusion matrix indicates the number of correct predictions and incorrect predictions for each class. It is particularly useful whenever the data has an imbalanced representation of the classes. The diagonals of a confusion matrix indicate the correct predictions for each class, while the cross-diagonal indicates misclassified predictions. Below is an example of a binary classification confusion matrix (i.e., there are only two classes)\n",

        "Woah! Despite the high accuracy score of the model, it looks like the model is classifying every unseen app as a \"free\" app (wouldn't that be nice). Let's take a look at a more comprehensive set of evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall. Precision indicates the model's ability ability to return only relevant instances. While recall indicates the model's ability to identify all relevant instances; and depending on our data we may want a higher precision score or vice versa. But if this sounds confusing right now don't worry, these metrics will become more clear as you work through logistic regression challenges. If your curious, here is an in-depth discussion of these metrics: [Beyond Accuracy: Precision and Recall](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-accuracy-precision-and-recall-3da06bea9f6c). "

        "It looks like our logistic regression classification model fit the data pretty well because it correctly predicted whether an app was free or not about 93.12% of the time on the test dataset. However, since our dataset is heavily imbalanced (i.e., skewed), with many more \"free\" apps than \"paid\" apps, we checked the precision and recall scores of the model too. The precision score is a perfect 100%, meaning our model identifies \"free\" apps 100% of the time. On the other hand, the recall score was 0%, meaning our model is not good at identifying \"paid\" apps. "
