        "\n",
        "Seaborn, which builds on Matplotlib, is like your friendly neighborhood artist. It takes complex data and, with a few lines of code, transforms it into neat, easy-to-understand, and good-looking graphs. No fuss, no stress, just clean and beautiful visuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then there's Matplotlib, the older, more powerful cousin. It might be a bit more complex, but it allows you to get down to the nitty-gritty. Want to change the color of a line, the label on an axis, or animate your plot? Matplotlib is your go-to. It's the library that gives you the reins to fully customize your visuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, as we go along, we'll get to know these tools better, learn how to make different kinds of plots, and pick up tips and tricks to make your data look as good as possible. Ready to dive in? Let's get started with Seaborn and Matplotlib!"

We can do this easily with Seaborn by converting our scatter plot to a lineplot. Seaborn will automatically compute the mean ranking for each years experience sport group.
